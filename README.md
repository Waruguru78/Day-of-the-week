# What You Should See
Visit the hosted github page to see this [Day of the Week app]() in action.

# Project Objective
This day of the week project uses JavaScript to create an application that displays the day of the week along with a corresponding quote.

It uses the JavaScript Date object and a switch statement.

# JavaScript Used
* Date() Object
* switch statement

# New Things Learned or Refreshed
Nothing new, but I did have a bug in my code.

Luckily, it only took me a few seconds to figure out.

I forgot my `break` statement in a few cases within my `switch` statement, which made my code pass through down to my last `case` statement.

So, I was getting Saturday even though today is Friday.
